# python-api-challenge

Attached are 2 folders. 

The folder labeled 'apiCode' contains parts 1 and 2 to the challenge, as well as a config file containing keys. The keys uploaded are fake for safety reasons, and will need user's personalized API keys.

The folder labeled 'outputData' contains the results from running the code. There is a csv file of the cities used for the code, as well as pictures of the resulting graphs.
